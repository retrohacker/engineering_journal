# May 29, 2018 - EurekaDNS healthcheck

Goal: Get EurekeaDNS healthcheck wired up to NodeQuark's health check

I've been noodling on this, and I think the best way to implement this is also
the simplest. For now we will just have the healthcheck handler kick off an
http request to EurekaDNS, and pass the result back through.

We have another open Jira where we want to expose the healthcheck endpoint to
userland code. We can generalize this logic then, but anything we do now to
further that goal will be over-engineering and will probable by redone then
anyways.

To unit test this, we can just use proxyquire to stub out the network call. If
we want an integration test, we can spin up our own server and validate the
service behaves as expected.

So lets break this down into some steps:

* Create a simple test app that demonstrates the behavior of an http client:
  * Querying an unhealth http endpoint (500)
  * Querying a healthy http endpoint (200)
  * Querying a non-existant http endpoint (?)
  * Take note of all three of these to determine how our mock should behave
* Update the existing unit test to define our healtcheck's expected behavior
* Implement our healthcheck

But! Before we go any further, I need to fix my vim configuration.

Right now my vim config is setup for `standard` linting. We use a different set of linting rules on our team at Netflix so I need to setup project specific configuration files. Let's tackle that now.

... researching ...

Looks like you need to add this to your .vimrc:

```vim
set exrc
set secure
```

Now you can create project specific vim configuration files.

The main thing I need to change is:

```
set tabstop=4           " 2 spaces per tab
set shiftwidth=4        " indentation
set expandtab           " tabs are Spaces
set autoindent          " Carry indents forward to newlines
set cindent             " Make autoindent context aware
```

And that should be it!

Bingo, working!

Now onto our test app.

... coding ...

Alright! Here is our snippet:

```js
var http = require('http');

const PORT = 5555;
const REQ_OPTS = new URL(`http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/`);

function createServer(statusCode, cb) {
  let server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.statusCode = statusCode;
    res.end();
  });
  server.listen(PORT, cb);
  return server;
}

function success(cb) {
  let server = createServer(200, function() {
    let req = http.request(REQ_OPTS, function(res) {
      console.log(`res.statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);
      server.close(cb);
    });
    req.end();
  });
}

function fail(cb) {
  let server = createServer(500, function() {
    let req = http.request(REQ_OPTS, function(res) {
      console.log(`res.statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);
      server.close(cb);
    });
    req.end();
  });
}

function noserver(cb) {
  let req = http.request(REQ_OPTS);
  req.on('error', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
  });
  req.end();
}

success(() => fail(() => noserver()));
```

And the output:

```text
res.statusCode: 200
res.statusCode: 500
{ Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5555
    at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1161:14)
  errno: 'ECONNREFUSED',
  code: 'ECONNREFUSED',
  syscall: 'connect',
  address: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 5555 }
```

So we know we need to check (and mock) `res.statusCode` and the `error` event, which means our mock needs to be an event emitter.

We are going to add one more todo: look at the events emitted from `res` to see what which way I want to handle the request.

... coding ...

Here is what I came up with:

```js
let error;
let status;
let cb = function (e) {
  console.log(`CALLBACK! ${e}, statusCode: ${status}`);
}
function done(e) {
  let callback = cb;
  cb = function noop() {};
  callback(e);
}
let req = http.request(REQ_OPTS);
req.on('response', function(res) {
  res.resume();
  status = res.statusCode;
  res.on('error', done);
  res.on('end', done);
});
req.setTimeout(1000, done.bind(null, new Error("ETIMEOUT")));
req.on('error', done);
req.end();
```

It handles the following cases:

* The request takes longer than 1s (it is on box, if we can't talk to it, or the service is latent, there is a problem)
* An error happens when reading the response
* An error happens when making the request
* The request complets with a status code
* Multiple events fire unexpectantly (we don't want to call the callback more than once)

Since we have most of the code written for this above, lets go ahead and start filling out the NodeQuark implementation first and we can follow up with tests.

... coding ...

Alright! The code is written though probably buggy.

Going to break for the evening and will write the tests tomorrow!
