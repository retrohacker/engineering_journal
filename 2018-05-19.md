Goal: To get `cd` to work using fuse

So yesterday we got a filesystem mounted that was able to respond to the
`getattr` request, but that is it. This allows `ls` in the parent's directory
to work, but it doesn't allow us to do anything else. Next thing we need to do
is `cd` down into the directory. When we attempt to `cd`, we can see `access`
firing. So lets start there.

We need to print out the arguments being passed to access so we can get a good
idea of what inputs we are working with. We should also consult the docs for
fuse to see what we can do for a response.

Let's get started!

... coding ...

And the result is:

```text
access
Request { ch: ChannelSender { fd: 3 }, header: fuse_in_header { len: 48, opcode: 34, unique: 4, nodeid: 1, uid: 1000, gid: 1000, pid: 6047, padding: 0 }, data: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] }
ino: 1
mask: 1
ReplyEmpty { reply: ReplyRaw { unique: 4, sender: Some(Box<ReplySender>), marker: PhantomData } }
```

We are given the inode of the file we are requesting, a ReplyEmpty object, a
mask, and the standard fuse request.

I'm not sure what the mask is, so we are going to have to look that up. The
empty reply is weird, does this mean `access` just grants permission to access
the folder? I'm also noticing something I missed yesterday in the `Request`
object, it looks like we get the user id and the group id of the user making
the request which could be a handy default for the uid/gid in the response for
`getattr`. Will keep that in mind and revisit it later.

For now, time to look at the docs.

... reading ...

So it looks like the empty reply really is just to signal "ok" or "error" back
to the user. So this endpoint is simple enough. What is confusing is the mask,
   it contains the requested permissions (read, write, and/or execute), but it
   isn't clear how to tell what the mask decomposes to. For now, we are going
   to say everything is valid, though later we may want to limit this.

... coding ...

And success! That was quick. `cd` now works!

access
lookup
```

We are going to save lookup for next time!
