# May 21, 2018 - Todd bot

The team I work on at Netflix has a super intense release process. Our team releases our code as an immutable artifact, in the form of a docker image. In addition, we use semver and semantic release. This results in a versioned immutable artifact that contains a changelog. As a result, our PR process is a bit ardous. Right now it is heavily manual and burns a lot of time, I'm going to try to automate it away with a chatbot.

I'm going to name this bot Todd, from Bojack :-)

First thing is first, I'm going to explore the chatops solution hubot.

This looks pretty straight forward. I provide regular expressions that I want to respond to, and then I can wire up arbitrary actions to them. All is well!

I think the low hanging fruit here is simply merging a PR. It looks like hubot has the ability to respond to arbitrary triggers through an event listener. I'm going to see if I can use that to allow team members to trigger a merge both through a slack command and directly on GitHub by commenting on the PR.

I've created a new private GitHub repo (unfortunately the project isn't open source yet, so my clone has to be private), that I can use for testing out the bot. This is where I'll have Todd interact with PRs to hide the development noise from the team.

I've pulled down the project from the Netflix repo and re-pushed it to my clone. This gives me a genuine GitHub repo as opposed to a fork (which is less featurefull).

Let's start figuring out how to get Todd wired up to GitHub.

Awesomesauce! I did a terrible job of updating this while I worked but the progress has been good. Todd now can merge a PR (validating it is following conventions) and can prepare the `next` branch for being released to our customers. This saves a lot of time.

The next step is to automate away the canary process but that will be for another time.
