Goal: To create a directory using a fuse mounted filesystem.

So I have a file system mounted with the [fuse](https://crates.io/crates/fuse)
crate, and I have a proof of concept append only log w/ a blockchain for
storing filesystem interactions
([codehere](https://github.com/retrohacker/rust-blockchain-fs/commit/3b9bc4d731727507b878211bf21231f0d80b34dc)).
Right now the filesystem just prints out when each `FileSystem` method is
invoked. I'd like to wire up the blockchain work to the fuse work and start
making a real filesystem that _does something_.

Right now, `getattr` is firing. It seems I need to invoke `ReplyAttr.attr` with
a TTL and a FileAttribute.

The `FileAttribute` structure looks like this:

```rust
pub struct FileAttr {
    pub ino: u64,
    pub size: u64,
    pub blocks: u64,
    pub atime: Timespec,
    pub mtime: Timespec,
    pub ctime: Timespec,
    pub crtime: Timespec,
    pub kind: FileType,
    pub perm: u16,
    pub nlink: u32,
    pub uid: u32,
    pub gid: u32,
    pub rdev: u32,
    pub flags: u32,
}
```

Unanswered questions:

* What should the size of a directory be? Is it safe to return 0?
* How many blocks should a directory be? What should a blocksize be in general
since this isn't actually backed by a block device?
* What is nlink?
* What are we going to do about file permissions and ownership?
* What is rdev?
* What are flags?

For the directory size, it looks like a simple `ls` shows directories as being
4096 on my system. It seems that is because the blocksize is 4096, and a
directory is technically a file and therefore must occupy at a minimum 1 block.
But there are files on my system that occupy _less_ than 4096 (i.e. a
`.gitignore` file that is 20bytes), is this surfacing the actual disk size for
directories and the number of bytes for the file itself for non-directories?
This is strange but a problem for another day, lets just try 0.

Let's get started by porting over the append only log, since we will need a
datastructure to interact with. Since fuse requires that ino number assignments
be valid for the life of the filesystem, not just the lifetime of the mount, it
looks like we are going to have to store those in the log as well. So we are
going to make some additions to the format:

```text
[line-hash] init [uuid] [name]
```

This line will create a named filesystem with a universally unique id. `name`
does not have to be exclusive, but `uuid` must never collide with another
filesystem on a machine. The `line-hash` is a hash of the current line. This
accomplishes two things, first it ensures the first hash of the blockchain is
unique (thanks to the `uuid`) and it allows for multiple filesystems to exist
naturally on the same machine even if they share the same name.

```text
[hash] mkdir [time] [id] [path]
```

This line will create a directory with the inode number `id`. Giving each file
an id that is unique to the log will allow us to honor the fuse requirement of
stable inode numbers between process restarts. This also has the nice benefit
of reducing the size of the log, since future lines can reference `id` which
should be shorter than `path` in most cases. In this case, `hash` is the hash
of the current line and the previous line's hash. `time` will be the timestamp
of the file change. It looks like almost every line will need to be accompanied
by a timestamp so we can properly report file time information back to the
kernel.


It also looks like we will need to support a line like:

```
[hash] attr ...
```

at some point to honor the expectations of fuse, but that is a bridge we can
cross later.

So lets take a look at building an blockchain AOL that can hold a directory and
respond to a `getattr` invocation. First we need to implement the `init` line,
so lets find or make a handy `uuid` crate...

Found it! The crate [`uuid`](https://crates.io/crates/uuid) should do the trick.
Next, we need to implement a constructor. This should create a new named Log
with a generated uuid.

... coding ...

Alright we have it!

[8c5a441](https://github.com/retrohacker/yourcloud/commit/8c5a4412495e1c014106a38c3fd426633cd00a88)

```text
init 38a4c916-21ed-4cb8-956d-362dcb93ca8f Hello World
```

It is immediately apparent that we have a problem. Our file is space delimited
and our filesystem names can have spaces. We should add quotes. Later we can
make quotes optional, but for now we will quote everything that is user
submitted.

... coding ...

And we are good!

```text
init 78814269-7ec2-4971-8690-c22f112a1558 "Hello World"
```

Next we need to add the hash. To do this, we need to take a sha hash of the
line. For now, we will go ahead and store that on the `Entry` object itself.
For generating the sha, we will use the
[rust-crypto](https://crates.io/crates/rust-crypto) crate, and for converting
it to a string we will use the [hex](https://crates.io/crates/hex) crate. I'm
opting for sha3-512 for now, we can relax that in the future if necessary (i.e.
to stem growth of the log).

... coding ...

Keeping the hash itself in the datastructure is proving to be messy, since it
requires serializing the `Entry` to hash it before it is constructed... Instead
I'm going to opt for hashing in the serialization funcion and keeping the hash
out of the log entirely.

... coding ...

Turns out `rust-crypto` supports converting to a hex, so I don't need the `hex`
crate after all.

... coding ...

Ah, looks like that project is dead, instead using
https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes

... coding ...

Looks like this module _does_ need `hex`, so pulling that back in.

... coding ...

Success!

```

Woah, look at that hash, super long. We can trim down in the future.

Alright. Next we need to add `mkdir`. Since every filesystem has a root,
`new()` needs to create it! We could probably get by with leaving `/` as
implicit, but it would be nice to have an actual `inode` entry in our log for
`1`.

For time, we are going to use the crate
[timestamp](https://crates.io/crates/time). The rest should be similar to the
previous command!

... coding ...

And success!

```

This isn't handling any validation with `mkdir` yet, we will save that for
later since we are only concerned with implementing `getattr`. For right now,
      you could create the same directory over and over and it would be valid.

Now, with this, we should have enough to implement `getattr`!

We are going to create a separate binary for our fuse stuff. This will let us
rapidly iterate on our API, we won't have to mount a fuse filesystem for every
change we make, only when we are working with the fuse stuff. We are going to
copy over our earlier project that logs functions as they are invoked, and will
work out from there. As a reminder, here are our outstanding questsions for
`getattr`:


* What should the size of a directory be? Is it safe to return 0?
* How many blocks should a directory be? What should a blocksize be in general
since this isn't actually backed by a block device?
* What is nlink?
* What are we going to do about file permissions and ownership?
* What is rdev?
* What are flags?

It looks like `rdev` is optional, it is for special files. Not sure if this
holds true in rust though, perhaps a `0` will suffice if not? `nlink` is the
number of hard links, we can keep that as `0` unless we decide to implement
hard links in our filesystem.

... coding ...

Alright, we have a filesystem mounted, and `ls` now works, but we are getting a
weird result for the file permissions. They are `d-w--wx-wT`...

... coding ...

Ah! I had `666` for the file permissions instead of `0o666`. Success!

```

To answer the remaining questions above:
* block size and file size can be `0` for folders
* for now, file permissions and ownership will just be root (`0`), that is
gross but /shrug
* rdev and flags are required but they can both be set to `0`

And we are calling it a day. We didn't reach our goal of _creating_ a directory
using fuse, but we did return a directory and that makes me happy.
