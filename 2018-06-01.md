Yesterday I burned through a lot of GitHub PR reviews, and wrote the code for an open restify issue:

https://github.com/restify/node-restify/pull/1668

I failed to keep a log, oh well....

One of the PRs I reviewed yesterday was for NodeQuark. It handles gracefully de-registering from our internal discovery service when the process shuts down through a normal means (i.e. SIGTERM). This provides much more robust discovery -- since we have a higher confidence that the services in discovery are actually alive -- and sets us up for safer autoscaling policies -- since we won't be routing traffic to downscaled instances.

The magic piece of code is this:

```
process.on('exit', () => eureka.unregister());
```

As it sits, this PR isn't really testable. Since this is such an important bit of infrastructure code, we want to make sure that we don't regress in the future (i.e. remove the listener by accident in a future PR!).

There are a few things we want to test:

1) That the proper handler is registered to the `exit` event
2) That the handler registered to the `exit` event actually calls `unregister`
3) That `unregister` is able to do it's thing before the process exits.

Part (1) and (2) require a refactor of the code. We need to break the cleanup code off into it's own module that can be invoked by itself. This will allow us to validate that one of the listeners registered to `process.exit` is that module, and it will allow us to invoke that module directly without having to emit `exit` of of process. For the second case, we can mock out `eureka` with proxyquire and we are good to go.

Part (3) is tricky. I can't think of a way to test this as part of our test suite so for now I'm going to settle for creating a test app that we manually verify does what we expect. Assuming it does what we expect today, that the `eureka` module is properly tested and does not regress, and that there aren't any changes to the way Node.js handles process shutdown, this should continue working in the future. These are some pretty large assumptions though, so I'll continue noodling on a better way to do this.

We can tackle (1) and (2) today, (3) we will need help from another team so we will do that next week.

Since the PR is 1 line of code and we are going to refactor everything anyways, lets just do this as a fresh PR.

... coding ...

Ah, so it looks like this code is burried down inside a constructor, we might be able to test it as is. If we mock out the constructor for registration using proxyquire, we can emit the `exit` event and ensure our constructor is called. Though we will need to clear out all other process.exit listeners before doing this.

... coding ...

Turns out this work is being driven by another team member. Yielding to them! Oops!

I'm going to put all of my thoughts into the GitHub PR and hand it off.
