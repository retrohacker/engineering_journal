# May 23, 2018 - Todd

So yesterday I burned a bunch of time updating my laptop's release to get a newer version of `git`. Today I'm planning on picking up where I was trying to go yesterday: hosting Todd inside of netflix's infrastructure.

Let's go!

So we have `newt` installed, lets try to create a new project.

... working ...

For some reason, when I connect to the netflix VPN using OpenVPN, none of the `go/*` links work (netflix has an internal URL shortening service). Seems to be an issue with DNS? Going to try to re-download and setup OpenVPN.

... working ...

Alright. I was given a tar file with all the openvpn configuration files that it wanted me to drop into /etc/openvpn. I have some other vpn configurations and I like to keep things organized, so I want these to live in /etc/openvpn/nflx.

I had to edit the following lines:

```
up "/etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf.sh ; /etc/openvpn/update-systemd-network.sh"
down "/etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf.sh ; /etc/openvpn/update-systemd-network.sh"
--- after
up "/etc/openvpn/nflx/update-resolv-conf.sh ; /etc/openvpn/nflx/update-systemd-network.sh"
down "/etc/openvpn/nflx/update-resolv-conf.sh ; /etc/openvpn/nflx/update-systemd-network.sh"
```

I also wanted to avoid having to type my password in everytime so here is the line that makes that happen:

```
auth-user-pass ldap.txt
```

But DNS still wont resolve.

... working ...

After several hours I found that `resolve.conf` isn't being updated with the Netflix DNS entries. I manually set those and it fixed it for now. This is a PITA hack to get DNS to work, I'll have to toggle this on and off everytime I connect.

But finally I can run `newt`.

So lets setup a project. First thing is first, we need to create a Dockerfile.

Let's use the public version of Node.js 8.

Heh, I always have to look up the proper `FROM` line: `FROM node:8`

Giving this a try:

```
FROM node:v8

WORKDIR /src
ADD package.json .
ADD package-lock.json .
RUN npm install
ADD . .

CMD ["./bin/hubot"]
```

and then `newt build`.

The docker image failed to pull.. Oh! its 8 not v8.

Cool looks like that built! But I didn't tag it. Rebuild w/ tag and then run it.

`docker build -t todd . && docker run -it todd`

```
npm WARN hubot-help@0.2.2 requires a peer of coffee-script@^1.12.6 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

up to date in 1.809s
todd>
```

Looks like I need to install coffee script, then rebuild.

COOL! It works. Now I need to wire it up to slack and I can deploy todd :-)

Oh bummer. I have to submit a request for adding a chatbot... Blocked on that.

Lets create our own slack to test this.

...

Alright we have todd wired up and working from slack. The next step is to get
todd his own GitHub profile so he isn't commenting under my name.

...

Done! Let's grab some screenshots of todd so that we can show off his l33tnerdballer skills.

... done!

OH! SNAP! Todd doesn't have an ssh key when they are inside a docker container, so they can't clone our repo! Lets have Todd generate a new key and add it to their github profile when they start up.

... coding ...

I'm using the command: `'ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f ~./ssh/github -q -N ""` to generate my ssh key and it is failing. Going to work on figuring out why.

Let's spin up a docker container and try to run this.... Oh yeah, look at that file name. No good. The `/` and `.` are flipped about.

And now its having problem reading the key, going to add the error to the message posted to slack.

... working ...

Oh! It isn't expanding the `~`, gotta provide an absolute path. Trying with `/root/`...

And now `createKey` isn't a function for octokit...

Ah, because it is off of `users`, lets try that.

And huzzah! Let's verify that we can ssh in.

```
$ docker exec -it [container_id] ssh git@github.com
permission denied
```

Sadness... Time to dig in.

`ssh -vvvv` shows that it isn't even looking at our private key. Possibly our filename is of the wrong form, lets just try `id_rsa`. Looking at the github side though, we do have the file uploaded to git. Instead of re-running all of this, lets just rename it and try ssh again.

And huzzah!

```
$ ssh git@github.com
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Hi todd-bot! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.
```

Alright, a quick tweak to the file path in the code and we are good to go.

Nice!

So update on where we are since that was a messy brain dump

Todd:
* is added to our GitHub project and can now manage it
* is included in our private slack
* merges PRs into next for us
* prepares next to be released
* can automatically upload it's private key to github for ssh access

What is left to do:
* Deploy Todd to Titus
* Get approval to add our chatbot to Netflix's chat

Oh heh, one last bug. It looks like `prepare next` doesn't work in a container because github isn't in the known hosts file. I actually have a blog post about this from a while ago that helps, thanks old me!

Oh, also, it needs to run `git config` and jq needs to be installed.

... working ...

Alright, after fighting with a bunch of small issues (death by a thousand cuts) todd is working!

We will tackle the "what is left to do" tomorrow :-)
