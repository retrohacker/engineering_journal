# May 21, 2018 - Todd bot

Alright! Going to continue my work with chatbot.

I would like to have this bot handle the canary process as well for releasing the `next` branch, but for now I have enough functionality for this thing to be useful. Let's go ahead and get it setup. The first thing I need to do is to get this running inside of the netflix infrastructure, then I need to get it integrated into the company slack.

My plan is to create a new titus application in spinnaker. I'll deploy todd bot as a container.

To get started, I'll need to install `newt` and create a new application.

Let's get started installing `newt`.

... working ...

When installing newt I get the following error:

`WARNING Unable to check newt-configs' origin: exit status 128`. I had the man pages for newt open at the time, and saw the same error inside of `man`, so maybe related? Let's try running the install again.

... working ...

Nope same error. I also get it when I run `newt`. Dropping into slack for support.

While I wait for a response from support, I'm going to poke around the `newt` source code to see if I can find the cause.

... reading ...

Ah! It looks like it emits this error when a call out to `git` fails, and the exit status `128` is coming from `git`.

```go
origin, err := newt.SystemCapture("git", "-C", configDir, "remote", "get-url", "origin")
```

Ah... it looks like the version of git I'm using is super old (1.9.1), time to upgrade distributions. It looks like there is a handy `do-release-upgrade` command on trisquel for upgrading to the latest LTS release. First I'm going to make sure all my important stuff is backed up and then I'm going to do that.

... backing up ...

I created a folder on goolge drive called `temp_backup` and pushed everything I needed to save there, and pushed all of my work up to GitHub. We should be good to go.

Hold onto your butts...

...

IT WORKED! It took most of the day, but I'm not running the latest LTS of trisquel. Calling it a day, should be able to deploy the bot tomorrow.
