Goal: Update todd bot to be totes legit

So todd is now "feature complete" and we have permission to add it to the netflix slack!

So what we need to do:

1. Configure the todd-bot slack integration
2. Add todd-bot to the Netflix GitHub repos that it needs to manage
3. Clone the spinnaker server group and update the environment variables to point to the proper github repo and slack
4. Announce todd-bot to the world! And by world I mean team.

So lets go!

... working ...

And he is released! Just waiting on feedback now.

Going to research some other tasks and put together a new goal.

...

Alright!

New Goal: Figure out what is needed to wire up the NodeQuark /healthcheck to the EurekaDNS /healthcheck

In our infrastructure, our apps offer up a /healthcheck endpoint to indicate whether our service is able to handle traffic. Currently, there isn't a Node.js implementation of Eureka resolution (used for service discovery), but there is a service that intercepts DNS requests and resolves them to services using Eureka. We use this inside of our NodeQuark containers to offer Eureka resolution to our applications, and it lives inside of our containers because our infrastructure does not yet support "pods".

Seeing as we have a second service in our container that our health is tied to, we need to have it be part of our healthcheck (since when the DNS service crashes we will be unable to handle requests).

My approach:

* spin up a NodeQuark service locally
* docker exec into the container
* query the eurekadns healthcheck endpoint to validate that it does what we expect
* check the eurekadns codebase to see how the endpoint is implemented (we need to trust that it reflects the daemon's healthy state if we are going to couple ourselves to it)
* check the NodeQuark codebase to see how we implement a healthcheck
* Noodle on how we could implement this in a testable way (this is a pretty important bit of our infrastructure, we want to have confidence that it works)

Alright! And we are off, looking at the documentation it appears that the daemon runs an HTTP server on port 8054 which provides a /healthcheck endpoint. Lets get a docker container up and running so we can validate this:

```text
mkdir nq_test_app && cd nq_test_app
newt init --app-type nodequark
... (skip setting up infrastructure, we just need local dev)
newt develop -b
```

Discovered our `newt init` process uses an old version of the platform, should fix that.

... fixing ...

Okay, PR opened in jira that updates the platform version from `^5.0.0` to `^6.0.0` in the nodequark init templates.

Now onto exploring eurekadns

```text
newt develop
```

And in another terminal

```text
docker ps
# find the container
docker exec -it [container] /bin/bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8054/healthcheck
* Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8054 (#0)
> GET /healthcheck HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8054
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Tue, 29 May 2018 03:21:46 GMT
< Content-Length: 8
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
<
< Healthy
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
```

Cool! That works. Now lets take a look at the source code.

```go
func isHealthy() (bool, int64) {
    currentTime := int64(time.Now().Unix())
    delta := currentTime - lastUpdateTime
    return (delta < healthyThreshold), delta
}
```

It looks like the health check is handled by the above function. It checks to see how long the service has gone without receiving an update for it's known services, and fails if that interval has been too long. This seems like there could be a lot of latency between when the service becomes unhealthy, and when it starts reporting unhealthy. We can make note of that and return to this later. For now, we can handle the following cases at the NodeQuark tier:

* The daemon has crashed (querying /healthcheck fails)
* The daemon is unhealthy (querying /healthcheck returns a non-200 status code)

If the underlying definition of "healthy" changes in the future, we should still be compatible with this contract.

Now lets find the NodeQuark healthcheck definition:

```
grep -ir 'healthcheck'
```

Found it! `/handlers/healthcheck.js`:

```js
'use strict';


/**
 * create a health check handler
 * @public
 * @function createHealthcheck
 * @param {Object} opts an options object
 * @return {Function}
 */
function createHealthcheck() {

    const payload = {
        status: 'ok'
    };

    return function healthcheck(req, res, next) {
        res.json(200, payload);
        return next();
    };
}


module.exports = createHealthcheck;
```

This is a super trivial implementation. We should make this a bit more reflective of the process' actual state. We have an open jira tracking exposing this health check to user land code so they can provide their own definitions of service health, so we will save noodling on making this better for that work. For now lets just focus on wiring this up to that daemon.

At this point, we have explored everything we need to expore. Going to break and noodle on how we can implement this in a testable way!
