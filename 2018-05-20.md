Goal: To get `ls` working inside the mounted directory

It is just past midnight, so saying "yesterday" is weird, but yesterday we got
`access` working. Now we can enter our mounted directory. Next I'd like to be
able to list files in this directory. This will require two things:

* Implement `opendir` (it is what fires when I type `ls` right now) * Add a
file to the log that we can report

Let's start with adding a file. We are going to need a new entry in our log to
support writing files, it will be of the form:

```text
[hash] write [time] [id] [path] [blob_hash]
```

* `hash` is the hash of the current line plus the hash from the previous line *
`time` is a timestamp (like before) * `id` is the unique id for the file in the
filesystem (like before) * `path` is the full path to the file in the
filesystem * `blob_hash` will be the hash of the data we are writing to the
disk

`write` will have two behaviors. On the first write, we will simply pass the
file straight through to disk as the blob. On every subsequent write to the
same `id`, we will diff the current file and the new file and this (compressed)
diff will be the blob we write. For now, we will just focus on the first
behavior, we can handle diffing when we support writing from the fuse mount.

We also need to support _writing_ this blob somewhere, which means we need a
folder on the disk that we are writing our data to. For now, we can just store
this as a `const`. Moving forward, we will want to make this configurable.

Let's get started

... coding ...

I'm realizing now that `[path]` isn't necessary for the second scenario so it
may be better to split these into two different commands. Maybe a `create` for
an initial write or a `touch` would be best for creating an empty file? For now
lets use `create` and we can change it later, this makes the line:

```text
[hash] create [time] [id] [path]
```

For now this will create an empty file, which side-steps the needing to store
the blob for now. We can tackle the whole storing data thing when we get to
writes from fuse.

... coding ...

And success!

```

Right now we aren't validating that the directory we are storing the file in is
valid, and that the file name itself is valid (and doesn't conflict with an
existing entry!), we will save all of that logic for when we are actually
exposing this method through fuse.

Now we need to serve this new file up through fuse. Lets dive into the
documentation for opendir.

... reading ...

Alright, it looks like we call `reply.add`, which has the following signature:

```rust
fn add<T: AsRef<OsStr>>(
    &mut self,
    ino: u64,
    offset: i64,
    kind: FileType,
    name: T
) -> bool
```

I'm not sure what `offset` is, but everything else here makes sense. The `bool`
tell's us when the underlying buffer for returning results is full. It isn't
clear if that means that the write failed, or that this write succeeded but
there is no more room.

The `readdir` invocation looks like this:

```rust
fn readdir(
    &mut self, 
    _req: &Request, 
    _ino: u64, 
    _fh: u64, 
    _offset: i64, 
    reply: ReplyDirectory
)
```

It isn't cleare what `fh` is. I believe `offset` is used to "pagenate" requests
when the response is larger than the buffer for a single response, but I need
to validate that. Everything else is straight forward!

So to summarize the outstanding questions:

* What is `fh` from `readdir`?  * ... Wait, I'm researching `readdir` and we
are supposed to be working on `opendir`

:facepalm: back to reading.

... reading ...

Alright, so this looks _mostly_ straight forward, with a bit of a twist. It
looks like `opendir` starts a stateful interaction with the filesystem that is
expected to live between `opendir` and `releasedir`, and is bound to the
returned file handle. It looks like we can get away with implementing stateless
I/O for now by not returning a file handle. I'm not sure what "not returning"
looks like in rust, is this just a `0`?

Here is the method signature for `readdir`

```rust
fn opendir(&mut self, _req: &Request, _ino: u64, _flags: u32, reply: ReplyOpen)
```

And `reply.opened`:

```rust
fn opened(self, fh: u64, flags: u32)
```

I'm going to try returning a `0` file handle and just passing the flags
through.

I'll also need to validate that the inode number is correct.

... coding ...

And success!

```text
init
Request { ch: ChannelSender { fd: 3 }, header: fuse_in_header { len: 56, opcode: 26, unique: 1, nodeid: 0, uid: 0, gid: 0, pid: 0, padding: 0 }, data: [7, 0, 0, 0, 22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 251, 247, 0, 0] }
getattr
access
opendir
ino: 1
mkdir 2018-05-20T08:04:40Z 1 "/"
readdir
releasedir
```

So it looks like the next thing we need to research is `readdir`, which is good
because we were pretty much done researching that already above :-)

So to summarize the outstanding questions we had: * What is `fh` from
`readdir`?  * Does `reply.add` succesfully add the entry when it returns false?
* Is `offset` for pagenation

We have already answered the first question when implementing `opendir`, it is
the stateful handle to our directory. Since we are stateless right now, we are
going to ignore that. Later, we will have to come back and support this. Since
we are only working with a single file, the other two questions aren't
important right now, we will revisit those once we start writing stuff to the
filesystem!

So let's get to work

... coding ...

It's a little after 1am and I'm tired. Calling it a night, will continue
tomorrow!
