Goal: Deploy todd bot

So we have a "good enough":tm: version of [Todd](https://github.com/retrohacker/todd) ready to deploy. We also have access to the Netfix VPN and `newt` setup and configured on our latpop (after a day of shaving yaks).

So we are finally ready to deploy!

I copied a `.newt.yml` file from another project and updated the values to:

```yml
name: EdsToddBot
org: edge-device-services
path-to-project: ./
repo-url: git@github.com:retrohacker/todd.git
spinnaker-app: eds_todd_bot
team-email: wblankenship@netflix.com
```

Now I'm heading over to spinnaker to create an application so I can deploy this service.

... filling out forms ...

Alright we have our spinnaker application. The next step is to publish our todd bot, though there is a minor change we need to make first:

Right now our credentials are being provided by a file on the filesystem, but we need to move to them being provided by an environment variable so Spinnaker can inject them when the container is provisioned. Luckily the file on the filesystem is _actually_ just `source`ed in, and it exports the environment variables before starting our app, so the only code change that needs to be made is to the hubot script.

... coding ...

Alright done! Now lets build the image...

`newt build`

... building ...

It is becoming apparent that I need to move to an SSD if I'm going to keep working on Docker stuff, lots of moving files around and my T400's HDD is super slow.

... still building ...

Ah, darn, this is building as retrohacker/todd:[tag].. It looks like the .newt.yml isn't doing anything so I'll just remove that and use this build string instead:

`newt build --image-name eds/todd --image-version 1.0.0`

If this works, all I'll need to do is re-run with the `--push` flag and it will be uploaded to the Netflix docker registry.

... building ...

And it worked! Alright lets push this thing.

... pushing ...

Well I had 3 browsers open (icecat, firefox, and tor) along with a push. This appears to have pushed my poor hard drive to its limits, the push failed. Going to close some stuff and retry.

... pushing ...

All of the layers get through `preparing` and then stall on `waiting`... Not sure what is happening here?

... waiting ...

Oh look at that. Looks like the push worked, it just took 15minutes for the first region. Waiting on 2 more regions... Need a faster hard drive.

... waiting ...

Finally! 35 minutes to push. Now lets get this bot deployed!

We need to deploy a titus container with Todd configured w/ the correct enviornment variables. We are also waiting on the security team to authorize our chatbot integration, hopefully they will be done with this before the day is over!

... filling out forms ...

Alright we are just waiting for the server group to be deployed...

And its up! Todd is running in our infrastructure. Exciting stuff. Now we are just waiting for the :+1: to get Todd added to our slack.

Going to take a break for a while, I'm happy with the progress we have made today.
